# smart-html-tags package

Provides capability to insert automatic end tag when completing the opening tag
i.e. typing '>'. Mixing templating languages such as PHP or Twig is also supported.

Unlike majority of all the others, this plugin is not a fork of another poor
implementation, instead built from scratch. All bugs are my own.
